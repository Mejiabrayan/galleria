# Photo Library Starter

Hey freeCodeCamp ðŸ‘‹ this is your starting point for digging into building your own Photo Library using Next.js and Cloudinary.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started, first create your new application by running the command below:

```
npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/colbyfayock/demo-photo-library-starter my-photo-library
```

> Tip: Alternatively, you can clone this repository, but running the above command helps with some additional tasks like resetting git history and installing dependencies!
